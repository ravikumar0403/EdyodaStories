        "courseDate" : "23 Aug 2019",
        "courseDetails" : "We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper."

        "courseDetails" : "Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud."

        "courseDetails" : "Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to gather and analyze information from the Internet. Some websites and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the internet."

This is evident from the fact that according to a recent survey by JetBrains 27% of Budding Developers have either started learning python or they have studied it in the past year. Python has been voted ad top programming language of 2018 by IEEE. In a monthly ranking of popular programming languages publishing by TIOBE, Python is now 3 rd just behind Java and C. It has emerged as the go-to language for web development, data science application development, Machine learning and also applications related to Big Data. Its popularity stems from several reasons like Its relatively easy to learn Its syntax is largely readable and lacks complexities of other competing languages. So developers can focus on applying logic rather than spending endless hours. Its a very versatile language Most of the operating systems support python. All services based on API and libraries also support python development. It is also object-oriented. Its business-oriented You can build any type of web application, software, GUI on python irrespective of any industry they are going to be deployed for. It's being used at Netflix & Google, all Financial Behemoths as well as startups."

It shapes how the objects are designed, what information we receive, how and where we work, who we meet and communicate. Each generation of computing technology brings new ways of creative tools, new forms of data and new ways to interact themselves. From the time we send messages through pager in hand to the time our voice command does everything for us, the software has a great role to play in. With the rise of the development of software, the need for software testing also rose. Software testing or Automation Testing plays a great role when the software is in the development phase. It aims to make the software perfect through various levels of testing for the convenience of humans."
